Dependancies
===========
Cytoscape Web

        It is expected that the Cytoscape Web code is downloaded into the /swf directory 
	on the same web server as FlowScale UI
        Cytoscape Web can be downloaded at http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/download

YUI Library
        configuation set for remote access, can be downloaded for
	 reliability and speed improvements or to
        support deployments where the Yahoo servers can not be accessed


Beacon
       The FlowScale backend utalises the BEacon API 


Install 
========


Binary Deployment
==================

Download 
	Download the tarball fomr [url] for your platform and extract to your desired directory

Configuration
	The following values could be configured:

	jetty listener port: 

	The port that listens to the HTTP server configured in Flowscale.  
	To change the port create a file called flowscale.properties in the root directory and add the value 	
	flowscaleController.jettyListenerPort=[your_port].

	Database properties:

	Creating a flowscale.properies file in the root directory also allows flowscale database values to be set:
	1) flowscaleController.port
	2) flowscaleController.host
	3) flowscaleController.username
	4) flowscaleController.password

	Controller (Beacon) Properties:
	Create a file called beacon.properites and add 
	controller.listenPort=[listner_port]

	Log level:

	Up to 4 levels may be logged (INFO,WARN,ERROR,DEBUG). To set the logger level and output see logback-example.xml
	You must update the flowscale-controller.ini to point to the right log configuration file:

	e.g.
	-Dlogback.configurationFile=logback-example.xml


	management console:
	If desiring to manage the osgi environment update the flowscale-controller.ini file and add
	-console
	[console-port]

	This will allow telnet to the port and the osgi cli will appear.



Deploy from Eclipse
=====================


Follow all the instruction from www.beaconcontroller.net to setup Beacon and openflowj, then 
download the source code from the repository:

 	git@github.com:InCNTRE/FlowScale.git	


In order to export the code as binary see the following:

https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Exporting+a+Binary





Database Deployment
=====================
Create a new database called webUI and run the file  and run the webui.sql
