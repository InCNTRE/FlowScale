{"name":"Flowscale","body":"FlowScale is a project to divide and distribute traffic over multiple physical switch ports. FlowScale \r\nreplicates the functionality in load balancing appliances but using a Top of Rack (ToR) switch \r\nto distribute traffic. Using software to handle the control plane specification but \r\nswitch hardware to do forwarding gives both great flexibility and allows for \r\nlow cost, high throughput deployments.\r\n\r\nFlowScale components are:\r\n\r\n* Web UI to administer how traffic is divided and providing a view of statistics and status\r\n* OpenFlow controller sending rules based on policy configured\r\n* OpenFlow capable ToR switch\r\n\r\n","tagline":"OpenFlow Based Load Balancer","google":"UA-30845168-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
