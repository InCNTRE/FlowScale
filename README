FlowScale is a project to divide and distribute traffic over multiple physical switch ports. FlowScale 
replicates the functionality in load balancing appliances but using a Top of Rack (ToR) switch 
to distribute traffic. Using software to handle the control plane specification but 
switch hardware to do forwarding gives both great flexibility and allows for 
low cost, high throughput deployments.

FlowScale components are:

* Web UI to administer how traffic is divided and providing a view of statistics and status
* OpenFlow controller sending rules based on policy configured
* OpenFlow capable ToR switch
